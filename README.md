# Sort no Jutsu 🧙‍♂️ - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sort no Jutsu is an interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built to help you visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It provides a seamless, engaging experience for users to learn and understand sorting algorithms through live visualization.

## ✨ Features ✨

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms 🧠:**
  - Visualize popular sorting algorithms: **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and more!
- **Real-time Speed Control ⚡️:**
  - Adjust the speed of the algorithm visualization in real-time to better understand each step.
- **Dynamic Array Size Control 📏:**
  - Choose the size of the array to sort, from small to large datasets, for more accurate visualizations.
- **Start/Stop Controls ⏸️:**
  - Start and stop the visualization at any time to examine specific steps or slow down the process for a deeper understanding.
- **Randomized Array Generation 🔀:**
  - Generate a new randomized array to see the algorithm work on different datasets.
- **Optimized Canvas Animation 🖼️:**
  - The visualization is highly optimized, delivering smooth animations and ensuring up to 100+ frames per second.
- **Progress Bar 📊:**
  - A progress bar displays the current progress of the algorithm, helping you track how far along the sorting process is.
- **Interactive Sound Effects 🎶:**
  - Hear real-time sound effects based on the frequency of numbers being compared during sorting, providing an additional sensory dimension.
  - Easily **mute or unmute** the sound effects with a dedicated button to suit your preference.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Next.js ⚛️:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript 📜:** Static type checker for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **Chakra UI 🎨:** Component library for building accessible and responsive user interfaces.
- **Zustand 🧠:** A state management library used to manage the sorting algorithm’s state and interactions.
- **HTML5 Canvas 🖼️:** Provides the base for rendering the animations smoothly and efficiently.

## 📝 Example Usage 📝

Upon running the app, you'll see a canvas where sorting algorithms are visually represented as they work through an array of numbers. You can interact with the visualization using the following options:

- **Select Algorithm:** Choose from various sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
- **Adjust Speed:** Control the speed of the visualization to slow down or speed up the sorting process.
- **Customize Array Size:** Change the array size to see how different sizes impact the algorithm’s performance.
