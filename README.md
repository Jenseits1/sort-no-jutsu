# Sort no Jutsu 🧙‍♂️ - Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sort no Jutsu is an interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built to help you visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It provides a seamless, engaging experience for users to learn and understand sorting algorithms through live visualization.

## ✨ Features ✨

-   **Multiple Sorting Algorithms 🧠:**
    -   Visualize popular sorting algorithms: **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and more!
-   **Real-time Speed Control ⚡️:**
    -   Adjust the speed of the algorithm visualization in real-time to better understand each step.
-   **Dynamic Array Size Control 📏:**
    -   Choose the size of the array to sort, from small to large datasets, for more accurate visualizations.
-   **Start/Stop Controls ⏸️:**
    -   Start and stop the visualization at any time to examine specific steps or slow down the process for a deeper understanding.
-   **Randomized Array Generation 🔀:**
    -   Generate a new randomized array to see the algorithm work on different datasets.
-   **Optimized Canvas Animation 🖼️:**
    -   The visualization is highly optimized, delivering smooth animations and ensuring up to 100+ frames per second.
-   **Progress Bar 📊:**
    -   A progress bar displays the current progress of the algorithm, helping you track how far along the sorting process is.
-   **Interactive Sound Effects 🎶:**
    -   Hear real-time sound effects based on the frequency of numbers being compared during sorting, providing an additional sensory dimension.
    -   Easily **mute or unmute** the sound effects with a dedicated button to suit your preference.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used 🛠️

-   **Next.js ⚛️:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
-   **TypeScript 📜:** Static type checker for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
-   **Chakra UI 🎨:** Component library for building accessible and responsive user interfaces.
-   **Zustand 🧠:** A state management library used to manage the sorting algorithm’s state and interactions.
-   **HTML5 Canvas 🖼️:** Provides the base for rendering the animations smoothly and efficiently.
